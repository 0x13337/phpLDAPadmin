phpLDAPadmin roadmap

0.9.3 planned features:
	Complete i18n. All strings localized.
	Add mass-update feature (user provides filter and set of attrs/vals to modify)
	No-schema mode of operation (some servers simply won't give us schema. This becomes a problem for normal operation)
	Search filter builder for simple search form (just select AND or OR for a group of criteria)
	Modification templates 
		user
		oragnizationalUnit
		posixGroup (view full DNs and browse buttons)
		sambaUser
		sambaMachine
	Samba 3.0 support in samba user and machine creation templates
	http auth_type (a la phpMyAdmin)
	read-only attributes (similar to hidden attributes) in config
	Support and test ActiveDirectory and iMail LDAP schema.
	Support for modifying replica entries (using ldap_set_rebind_proc())
	Add blowfish encryption to encrypt cookie-stored passwords and DNs.
	Default mod template: Add a "browse" button for attributes that store DNs.
	Add output buffering when including lang files so no output is sent to the browser (which could cause problems for sessions and cookies)
	Add a random hint on the welcome page
	Paging search results.
	Anonymous binds redirect to search page with no tree viewer (as an option in config)
	Move template config to a new config file: template_config.php (or something)

0.9.4 planned features:
	Hidden/read-only attrs on a filter-basis (ie, different users have different viewable, writable	attributes)
	Seious compatibility testing for additional LDAP servers.
	Configuration for templates.
	Template instances with unique config.
